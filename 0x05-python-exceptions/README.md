Python Exceptions are a way of handling errors with a try and except tags. There is also 
another tag to raise errors purposely.
n exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. ... An exception is a Python object that represents an error. When a Python script raises an exception, it must either handle the exception immediately otherwise it terminates and quits.
